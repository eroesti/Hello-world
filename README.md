# Hello-world
Just a test


First, check the branches. Branches are used besides the main one, in order to fix features work separate from the main. When a change is then rready on a provisional branchm this can be merge into main.

Adding some additional information while on the `readme-edits`. This, when finished, will be merged with the main branch. Before the merge, this README.md and the one in the main, will be different.

Let's open now a `Pull request` !

When you open a `Pull request`, youâ€™re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

Lets' pull a request by hitting the `Pull Request` up !!
